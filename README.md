# KTGNN
Source code and datasets (twitter) of KTGNN.

Steps to run the code:
* First unzip the .rar file in ./datasets/twitter/raw/raw.rar

  * The size of the raw dataset is too large to upload onto  the reponsitory, so we zip the original files first.
* Then run KTGNN with the following command:

  ```shell
  python3 main_twitter.py
  ```
